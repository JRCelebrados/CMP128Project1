        <p>I am Jesus Celebrados, currently a senior at Lehman College. I am hoping to get a Bachelor in Computer Science. I have always been interested
        in technology, and being on my computer a lot, I hope to make it my life. I am also an artistic person, having taken Computer Graphics classes
        at the New York Institute of Technology. I hope to combine these two passions by pursuing a career in front end development. I am some HTML and
        CSS experience, having taking them in Lehman's Hackathons and the Tech Talent Pipeline Bootcamps. My HTML and CSS knowlege were learned at random
        times, and so I am taking <a href="http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/sfulakeza/">CMP 128</a>
         to learn them in a more orderly manner, in case there are some basic, but very important skills, that I may have
        missed. I also realize that my JavaScript skills are lacking compared to my front-end skills, so by taking CMP 128, I hope to brush up on them.
        Although it is front-end that I am most passionate about, I believe that any aspiring web developer should be competent at back-end.
